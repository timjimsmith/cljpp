A Clojure to C++ cross-compiler. Not even close to ready yet. Stay tuned.

## For those who may want to contribute

Here are some resources to get started

- Learn C++: https://www.learncpp.com/
- Immer: https://github.com/arximboldi/immer
- Nix: https://nixos.org/nix/

No idea how long something of this magnitude will take since the original creators have never done something like this before.

Probably gonna be Apache License 2.0, but TBD.
